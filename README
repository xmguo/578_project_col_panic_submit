BookSim 2.0 is in ./BookSim
Dally's RTL is in ./Verilog

The subdirectories in ./BookSim and ./Verilog have the same structures as the original software.
However, only the modified files are included.
Simply copy the modified files to the corresponding directory of the original software.

Special note for running Booksim:
  The config file that we used for simulation is located at src/example/mesh33
  To enable DoS detection, add -DTRACK_DOS to flags when compiling
  To enable SPEAR, add -DPRIV_MODE to flags when compiling
  The injection rate of node 0 is defined separately by comp_rate. 
  You can set that it in the config file by adding comp_rate=(value), just like how injection_rate is set.
  It defaults to 0.1 if not explicitly specified.


Special note for running Verilog:
  We added a new directory called syn/ 
  It contains the tcl file as well as a Makefile
  To run synthesis, type make
