ScureNoC: Enhancing On-Chip Network Security for Many Integrated Core Systems
Authors: Xiaoming Guo, Sijia He, Amlan Nayak, and Jay Zhang


BookSim 2.0 is in ./BookSim
Dally's RTL is in ./Verilog

The subdirectories in ./BookSim and ./Verilog have the same structures as the original software.
However, only the modified files are included.
Simply copy the modified files to the corresponding directory of the original software.

Special note for running Booksim:
  Additional compilation flags were added to the Makefile
  to enable/disable DoS detection and recovery mechanism
  and SPEAR. The flags are named as follows:
  TRACK_DOS := enable DoS tracking and recovery mechanism
  PRIV_MODE := enable SPEAR infrastructure
  
  Please uncomment these flags in the Makefile to run simulations
  with the security mechanisms enabled. After modifying the Makefile
  ensure that you 'make clean' before running 'make.' 
  The config file that we used for simulation is located at src/example/mesh33
  To enable DoS detection, add -DTRACK_DOS to flags when compiling
  To enable SPEAR, add -DPRIV_MODE to flags when compiling
  The injection rate of node 0 is defined separately by comp_rate. 
  You can set that it in the config file by adding comp_rate=(value), just like how injection_rate is set.
  It defaults to 0.1 if not explicitly specified.

Special note for running Verilog:
  We added a new directory called syn/ 
  It contains the tcl file as well as a Makefile
  To run synthesis, type make
